    <p>  These are the people who will make you become pro so that you can teach these guys that gaming is not a thing couple should do together</p>
    <pre>
Things to do when we found couple in a game
1. Kill them as many times as possible so that they won't play ever again with each other even though you lose the game
2. Torment his gf many time as you like during the game
3. Lastly don't forget to say nub to his gf all the time.
